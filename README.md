#Mobile EEG and Computational Tools for Auditory Research

Music and speech are complex human expressions, product of dynamic processes in the brain. In this neuroscience workshop, we will record brain activity using a custom and mobile electro-encephalogram (EEG) to study:
The fundamental patters of cortical brain activity unfolding over time.

The specific relationships between cortical activity and the acoustic stimuli that trigger it.
Experiments that we can bring outside the lab to investigate the brain in realistic scenarios.
Machine Learning and Statistical tools to clean, analyze, and visualize EEG data.
Artificial neural networks as tools for modeling of brain activity.

After an overview of fundamental concepts from music theory, acoustics, mathematics, neuro-science, and computer science, we will start analyzing pre-recorded EEG data to untangle the information about brain processes. We will then review scientific literature in preparation to de-sign a couple of experimental paradigms to be carried out in the realistic scenario of your choice. After experimental design, we will collect and analyze EEG data to build a computational model that describes the brain activity captured by our experiments.

Topics to be covered:
Anatomy and physiology of the peripheral and central auditory systems.
History and functionality of modern EEG systems.
Analysis of electrophysiological data using Matlab and Python libraries.
Neuroscience literature on cognition of music and speech.
Modeling of brain activity using Neuroscience-Inspired Artificial Neural Networks.
Individuals with diverse academic backgrounds can be successful in this workshop. Previous experience in computational neuroscience research is not a prerequisite. Ownership of a mobile EEG is not necessary, but if you are interested in buying/building one, please contact the instructor for options. We will be happy to answer and clarify any questions related to this workshop. Looking forward to seeing you in August!
